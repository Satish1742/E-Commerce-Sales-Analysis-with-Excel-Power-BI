# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-with-Excel-Power-BI
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data using Excel and Power BI to understand business performance.

Excel was used to clean and organize the data, remove duplicates, and calculate total sales, profit, and order quantity.

Pivot tables and charts in Excel helped identify basic sales trends.

Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards and reports.

Key metrics such as total revenue, total orders, and profit were analyzed.

Sales were analyzed by product category, time period, and country.

Country-wise analysis helped identify high-performing and low-performing markets and provided useful insights for business growth.

Filters and visuals made it easy to explore the data and understand patterns.

This project helps businesses make better decisions, improve sales strategies, and increase overall performance.
